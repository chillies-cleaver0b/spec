    ### Introduction


    Zamzar provides a simple API for fast, scalable, high-quality file conversion for 100s of formats. Our API can be used to convert files on your machine, or files accessible over HTTP, FTP, SFTP or even Amazon S3.


    ### Custom Headers

    All requests to Zamzar endpoints include the following headers in the response:

    `Zamzar-Credits-Remaining` shows the number of file conversion credits remaining in the current billing period

    `Zamzar-Test-Credits-Remaining` shows the number of credits remaining in the current billing period for `sandbox.zamzar.com`

    ### Response Codes

    Every response contains an appropriate HTTP status code:

    ```
    Successful requests:
    200 OK
    201 CREATED - a new resource was created
    204 NO CONTENT - the body of the response is empty
    307 TEMPORARY REDIRECT - access the resource by following the location header of the response

    Errors:
    401 FORBIDDEN - the request is not using authentication
    402 PAYMENT REQUIRED - the request cannot be completed because this account does not have sufficient credit
    404 NOT FOUND - the requested resource does not exist
    410 GONE - the requested resource is no longer available
    413 PAYLOAD TOO LARGE - the request is too large, typically because a source file exceeds the maximum file size for this account
    422 UNPROCESSABLE - the request was malformed (e.g. missing a required parameter)
    429 TOO MAY REQUESTS - the request has exceeded a rate limit

    500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR - an unexpected internal error has occurred
    503 UNAVAILABLE - the API is temporarily unavailable
    ```

    ### Rate Limits

    In order to provide a stable and reliable service for all users, rate limits are applied to different API endpoints:

            ### When using cURL

            Save the content of a file to disk using curl options `-L` (follow redirects), `-O` (Write output to a local file) and `-J` (use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename). Or specify your own filename by redirecting the output of your HTTP call:

            ```shell
            curl --request GET \
              --url https://api.zamzar.com/v1/files/123456/content \
              --header 'Authorization: Basic xxxxxx' \
              --header 'Content-Type: application/json' -L \
             -L
             -O \
             -J

            A `paging` object is included within the results, with each page having a limit of 50 records by default. Request the next page by using the `after` parameter in reference to the `last` property within the paging object of the current response. 

            For example to retrieve the next page of formats after the `msg` format:

            ```

        Submit a conversion job for a local file, an uploaded file, a remote URL or S3 bucket.

        ### Starting a job for a local file
        To start a conversion job and upload a source file in a single request, issue a multipart POST request to the jobs endpoint. One part of the request should specify the target format and (optionally) a source format:

         - `source_file`: The binary data of the source file containing the following headers:
           - `Content-Type` - an Internet media type that indicates the format of the data in the body of the request
           - `Content-Length` - the size, in bytes, of the data in the body of the request
         - `target_format`: the identifying name of the format that `source_file` will be converted to
         - `source_format`: optionally the identifying name of the format of the `source_file` (and is used to specify a source format that is different to the extension of the `source_file`)

        ### Starting a job for a url
        To start a conversion job for a source file that resides on another server, issue a POST request to the jobs endpoint with the following parameters:

          - `source_file`: The url of the file to be converted. Examples:
            - `http://www.example.com/logo.png`
            - `https://www.example.com/logo.png`
            - `https://username:password@www.example.com/logo.png`
            - `ftp://ftp.example.com/logo.png`
            - `ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/logo.png`
            - `sftp://username:password@sftp.example.com/logo.png`
          - `target_format`: the identifying name of the format that `source_file` will be converted to
          - `source_format`: optionally the identifying name of the format of the `source_file` (and is used to specify a source format that is different to the extension of the `source_file`)

        ### Starting a job for an Amazon S3 file
        To start a conversion job for a source file that resides on Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), first determine whether you need to setup any credentials to access the file. If needed you can configure access to Amazon S3 via the [Connected Services](https://developers.zamzar.com/user/services) page.

        Next, determine the S3 URL to send to our API. The S3 URL will use one of the styles shown below. For private files, note that CREDENTIAL_NAME must match exactly the credential name you have used on the [Connected Services](https://developers.zamzar.com/user/services) page.

          - Public file - `s3://my-bucket-name/logo.png`
          - Private file - `s3://CREDENTIAL_NAME@my-bucket-name/logo.png`

        Once you have determined the S3 URL, issue a POST request to the jobs endpoint with the following parameters:

          - `source_file`: the Amazon S3 url of the file to be converted
          - `target_format`: the identifying name of the format that `source_file` will be converted to
          - `source_format`: optionally the identifying name of the format of the `source_file` (and is used to specify a source format that is different to the extension of the `source_file`)

        ### Starting a job for a file which has already been uploaded
        To start a job for a file that you’ve already uploaded to our servers, issue a POST request to the jobs endpoint, with the following arguments:

          - `source_file`: the unique identifier of the file that will be converted
          - `target_format`: the identifying name of the format that `source_file` will be converted to

      description: 'When you request a list of of all resources of any type (files, formats, jobs), you will receive a paged collection as a response. A paged collection allows you to view a subset of the entire collection (limited to 50 elements) and makes it easy to implement pagination in your application. Use the `limit` parameter to limit the number of results and the `after` parameter to request the next page of results (based on the value of `last` within the paging object).'
